# Introductie Webservices

_Text only available in english_

The 2BA Webservices are elementary, lightweight and fast services to allow your systems to integrate with the 2BA database. We offer services to search our database, retrieve product- or article details and services to, for example, download your selection profiles automatically. Our webservice is not intended for bulk downloads, it is intended to update a targeted number of articles quickly. For bulk downloads we recommend direct downloads or the use of 2BA selection profiles.

We offer our services via JSON (Rest services) and SOAP (XML service). The advantages of JSON in comparison to SOAP are, among others, reduced overhead and simplicity. For both JSON and SOAP services, most development environments either offer libraries or have the support built-in.
