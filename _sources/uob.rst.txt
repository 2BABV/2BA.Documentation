Uniforme Objecten Bibliotheek (UOB, Uniform Objects Library)
============================================================

You, the UOB and 2BA: Working together for the future
UOB normalThe Uniforme Objecten Bibliotheek (UOB, uniform objects library) is a new and ground-breaking CAD platform for the installation sector. The library allows selected, specific product data to be automatically linked to a generic template CAD object. Directly from 2BAâ€™s product database!

What is the UOB?
The Uniforme Objecten Bibliotheek is an intermediate software platform between CAD systems on one side and the 2BA datapool on the other. Using the UOB, CAD engineers and/or modellers can specify an object using a wide range of template CAD objects linked to ETIM product classes in combination with product data from manufacturers participating in 2BA.

In order to make a generic template object from the UOB design specific, the UOB makes it possible to involve real-time relevant product information from the 2BA database in this process. The ETIM MC (Modelling Class) data provided by participating manufacturers to 2BA for this purpose serves as an important selection criterion. This largely concerns the geometric (read: size) data of your products.
